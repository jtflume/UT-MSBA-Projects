# Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning

For this project, we leverage the YOLOv4-tiny model to detect sign language inputs in image, video, and real-time formats. This work leverages transfer learning and has computational advantages in addition to accuracy and learning capabilities. Our results show that our model successfully works on images, videos, and real-time input forms.
